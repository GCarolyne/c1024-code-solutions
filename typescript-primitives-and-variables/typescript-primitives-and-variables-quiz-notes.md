## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of variables?
  Variables act as containers for storing data values.

- How do you **declare** a variable?
  We declare variables using var, let, const. In most cases we use const. In some cases we use let when we expect the variable to change.

- How do you initialize (**assign a value to**) a variable?
  We use the = symbol as the assignment operator in Typescript. It assigns the value on its right to the variable on its left.

- What characters are allowed in variable names?
  Characters include letters, digits, underscores, dollar signs but must start with a letter, $, or \_

- What does it mean to say that variable names are "case sensitive"?
  case sensitivity means that capitalization of the variable matters. Two variable with the same name, but with different capitalization, are treated as 2 separate variables.

- What is the purpose of a string?
  A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.

- What is the purpose of a number?
  In typescript numbers are used to represent both integer and floating-point values.

- What is the purpose of a boolean?
  Booleans represent one of two values true or false.

- What does the `=` operator mean in JavaScript?
  It assigns the value of a variable on the right to its left.
- How do you update the value of a variable?

- What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?

The two primitive values represent the absence of a meaningful value.

- Why is it a good habit to include "labels" when you log values to the browser console?

This makes it easier to find the code in the browser console. Helps identify where the code is located much easier.

- Give five examples of JavaScript primitives.
  String - represents textual data
  number-represents numerical data
  bigint- represents integers with arbitrary precision
  boolean - represents logical values true and false
  symbol - represents a unique and immutable value
