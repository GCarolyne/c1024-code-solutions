## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is a function in JavaScript?
  A fucntion is used to pack up code for reuse throughout a program.
  Giving a name to a handful of code statements.

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**.
  We need a function keyword to begin the creation.
  An optional name.
  A comma separated list of zero or more parameters, surrounded by ().
  the start of the functions code block is indicated by a opening curly brace.
  A optional return statement
  the end of the functions code block.
- Describe the parts of a function **call**.
  Once defined a function is another kind of object. We call the function by simply writing out the name of the function and placing parentheses next to it.
- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**?
  A definition is specific defined function saying to what the function will be doing.
  The call is activating the function to work.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**?
  A parameter is a placeholder. It is a variable whose value is not known until we call the function and pass an argument. When the functions code block is run, the parameter will be holding the value of the argument.
  When we define a function we declare parameters and when we call a function we pass it arguments.

- Why are function **parameters** useful?

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function?
  Causes the function to produce a value we can use in our program.
  prevents any more code in the functions code block from being run.

- What is the syntax for defining an arrow function?
  There is no return statement.
  There are no{} to indicate a code block.
  The code block consists of only one line of code ( an expression)

- When an arrow function's body is not surrounded in curly braces (_concise body syntax_), what changes in its functionality?
  nothing the function automatically returns after the => sign.
