## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- Will AI replace software developers?
  AI is transforming many aspects of software development, but it's unlikely to fully replace software developers. Instead, AI tools can assist developers by automating repetitive tasks, suggesting code improvements, and helping with debugging. This allows developers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their work.

The role of software developers may evolve, with an increased emphasis on collaboration with AI tools, problem-solving, and designing systems that leverage AI capabilities. Developers will still be essential for understanding user needs, architecting solutions, and ensuring that software meets quality and ethical standards. So, while AI will change the landscape of software development, it will not eliminate the need for skilled developers. AI ANSWER

I dont think AI is going to replace software developers in the near future.

- What is the best way to use AI tools when learning software development?

Supplement Learning: Use AI tools to complement your studies. Let them assist with code suggestions or explanations, but always strive to understand the underlying concepts.

Ask Questions: Use AI to clarify doubts or explore concepts you find challenging. Engaging with the tool can help deepen your understanding.

Code Review: After writing your code, use AI tools to review it for best practices, potential bugs, and optimization opportunities. This can provide insights into areas for improvement.

Experiment and Explore: Use AI to experiment with different coding methods or approaches. This can help you learn alternative solutions and broaden your understanding of the language or framework.

Build Projects: Incorporate AI tools while working on projects. Use them for debugging or generating boilerplate code, but ensure you understand every part of the code you’re using.

Learn from Mistakes: If an AI-generated suggestion leads to an error or unexpected behavior, take the time to investigate why it happened. This can be a valuable learning experience.

Stay Updated: AI tools often incorporate the latest best practices. Use them to stay informed about new trends, libraries, and technologies in software development.

Collaborate: If you're working with others, discuss AI-generated solutions and explore them together. This encourages critical thinking and team collaboration skills.

Practice Coding Independently: Set aside dedicated time to code without AI assistance. This helps reinforce your skills and build confidence in your abilities.

Reflect on Learning: Regularly assess what you've learned through AI interactions. Identify areas where you still need improvement and adjust your study focus accordingly.

Ask AI the following : give a quiz question, explain a concept, define what a type of code function for example will do. AI answer

WHile learning the foundations of software development it is not smart to use AI tools learning is more important then receiving a quick solution.

- What is the danger of using AI tools for software development while I'm still learning?
  Over-reliance on AI: Relying too much on AI tools can hinder your learning process. You might become dependent on suggestions and automated coding, which can prevent you from fully understanding fundamental concepts.

Lack of Critical Thinking: AI can provide solutions that might not be optimal or appropriate for your specific context. If you don’t critically evaluate the suggestions, you may miss important learning opportunities.

Incomplete Knowledge: AI tools might not always explain why a particular solution is effective. Without understanding the underlying principles, you may find it difficult to troubleshoot issues or adapt to new challenges.

Quality of Code: AI-generated code may not adhere to best practices or may contain security vulnerabilities. Learning to write clean, efficient, and secure code is crucial for your development skills.

Limited Problem-Solving Skills: If you rely on AI for problem-solving, you may not develop the skills to tackle challenges independently, which is a vital part of being a successful developer.

Ethical Considerations: AI tools can sometimes produce biased or unethical code. It’s important to understand the implications of using AI in your development process. AI ANSWER

AI tools work on the basis of prediction. They will only predict the next step of what it already sees in the code. It can produce code that those not work, is bugged. AI answer

No learning. It can lead to simply copying and pasting which can burden the learning process.
